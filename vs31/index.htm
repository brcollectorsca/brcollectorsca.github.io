    Ebola Syndrome
   </a>
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    I vividly remember the process of restoring Ebola Syndrome. The elements were in rough shape, and 4k is unforgiving regarding hiding damage. We made countless passes, and I went through this film frame by frame for weeks. It was like Clockwork Orange, watching all the sex and violence over and over. In restoration, there's no audio, no dialogue or subtitles, and no rhythm to the narrative. Just what you see on screen. And this movie looked fucking wild. Sex, dismemberment, golden showers, and murder...and that's only the first 5 minutes. When I finally got to watch the movie, I was ready for the depravity and dying to discover what was happening in the story. By the end, I was completely blown away. The story took twists and turns, was equal parts hilarious and atrocious and checks off all things you want in an extreme horror film. Add in Anthony Wong and all the charm he brings to the scuzziest of characters, and this was an instant classic. When it comes to VS releases, I'm proud of the work we did, but more importantly, this movie fucks, and it should be on every film lover's shelf.

    Flesh and Fantasy
   </a>
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    The images on the screen during its runtime bring to mind films such as Carnival of Souls, Eyes Without a Face, and my all-time favorite, The Night of the Hunter (Stanley Cortez was the Cinematographer on both NOTH and Flesh and Fantasy!). While viewing it for the first time, I was so taken aback by the nightmarish imagery on the screen that I could not fully absorb it all, so I re-watched it a second time immediately afterward. Flesh and Fantasy is a forgotten masterpiece that needs to be experienced by anyone who loves cinema.

    Fatal Games
   </a>
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    Fatal Games belongs in any self-respecting slasher movie completist’s collection. From the bonkers premise of a javelin-wielding maniac picking off Olympic hopefuls, to the laws of physics-defying death sequences (not to mention the killer theme song), Fatal Games is an absolute treat for fans of stalk-and-slash. What makes our release of the movie even more special is that this one truly defied the odds, with usable mastering elements proving elusive until only recently - and of course, the film comes accompanied by our usual array of newly-produced bonus features, laying bare the story of this unique production for the first time!

    Vacation of Terror 1 &amp; 2
   </a>
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    Are you looking for a spooky double feature with a possessed doll and 80s fashion? Look no further! Join Mexican music idol Pedro Fernández as he battles a doll with supernatural powers, alongside soap opera villain Gabriela Hassel in the first part and pop singer Tatiana in the sequel. Growing up in Mexico City in the 1980s, both titles were special to me. Producing the extras allowed me to pay tribute to the talented crew behind the practical effects at the iconic Estudio Churubusco and to the young actors, some of whom had successful careers in the entertainment industry.

    Satan's Blood
   </a>
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    "As someone who had no exposure to VS prior to working here, I had a lot of catching up to do. What better place to start than with Spanish, devil-worshiping horror? Satan’s Blood was one of my first VS watches and really helped me to understand the lure of what we put out. It’s an 82-minute, atmospheric descent into madness featuring charming main characters, a fun score, lots of gore, and a near-perfect ending. The addition of a human skull full of body butter and an eerie Ouija board scene definitely cement it as an essential October watch."

   <p>
    "Demonoid aka Macabra will always remain near and dear to me, as it was one of the first films I had the pleasure of restoring. What's not to like about going frame by frame removing specks of dust, as Samantha Eggar uncontrollably spins around the room with a demonic hand grasping at the back of her head?! The movie itself is a trip, following a cursed, evil hand stopping at nothing as it jumps from one victim to the next."

    Singapore Sling
   </a>
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    "Nikos Nikolaidis’s kinky, darkly comical, chamber drama of horrors is like Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant for the S&amp;M set. Shot in a murky black and white, with an emphasis on meat, body hair, leather, and fluids, Nikolaidis lays his perversions, and fears, bare for a world audience to witness. Not a traditional horror movie by any stretch, SINGAPORE SLING has a more freewheeling kinship to the politically astute, and similarly transgressive, films of Dušan Makavejev than any of the titans of scare cinema, but there’s a reason Nikolaidis’s film has remained a stable of international freak-out cinema for over three decades; are you daring enough to discover why?"

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    "Redneck Zombies catalyzed my, then unknown, love for [good] low-budget SOV movies. With likeable characters, great special effects and a fun story, it was unlike anything SOV I had ever seen at that point. I was used to being bored to tears while characters aimlessly wander or stand around saying and doing a whole lot of nothing. The opening theme song, the gory acid freakout and director Pericles Lewnes' Buck Flower caliber performance as "Elly May" will charm you right out of your burlap sack."

   <p>
    "There aren't many Colorado-made, feature-length horror films, and I can't think of any that came out of the small steel-producing city of Pueblo. CURSE OF THE BLUE LIGHTS (1988) was made by a DIY team that did so much with so little, resulting in a spooky, atmospheric horror film. Be sure to check out “Demons Down in Pueblo: Remembering Curse of the Blue Lights" - a new making-of documentary on the Blu-ray featuring interviews with cast + crew shot at our very own Denver Archive store! BLUE LIGHTS is a fun group watch; give it a go this Syntober! Go Colorado!!"

  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    "“They don’t allow you to have bees in here.” I discovered The Bees on my very first day of working at Vinegar Syndrome. Oscar was trying to show me the thousands of reels of film that still needed to be inspected, but I was too focused on one particular box of Blu-rays… “THE BEES!?!” I exclaimed. What a title! Now that’s a movie I need to watch. If you’re looking for a good example of MAN VS NATURE or ECO HORROR, then look no further than The Bees! What’s it about? The dangers of invasive species! Forget about spotted lanternflies - killer bees have invaded the United States, and John Saxon needs to get them under control before it’s too late."
