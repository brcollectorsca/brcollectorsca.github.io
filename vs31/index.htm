    Ebola Syndrome
   </a>
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    I vividly remember the process of restoring Ebola Syndrome. The elements were in rough shape, and 4k is unforgiving regarding hiding damage. We made countless passes, and I went through this film frame by frame for weeks. It was like Clockwork Orange, watching all the sex and violence over and over. In restoration, there's no audio, no dialogue or subtitles, and no rhythm to the narrative. Just what you see on screen. And this movie looked fucking wild. Sex, dismemberment, golden showers, and murder...and that's only the first 5 minutes. When I finally got to watch the movie, I was ready for the depravity and dying to discover what was happening in the story. By the end, I was completely blown away. The story took twists and turns, was equal parts hilarious and atrocious and checks off all things you want in an extreme horror film. Add in Anthony Wong and all the charm he brings to the scuzziest of characters, and this was an instant classic. When it comes to VS releases, I'm proud of the work we did, but more importantly, this movie fucks, and it should be on every film lover's shelf.

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    The images on the screen during its runtime bring to mind films such as Carnival of Souls, Eyes Without a Face, and my all-time favorite, The Night of the Hunter (Stanley Cortez was the Cinematographer on both NOTH and Flesh and Fantasy!). While viewing it for the first time, I was so taken aback by the nightmarish imagery on the screen that I could not fully absorb it all, so I re-watched it a second time immediately afterward. Flesh and Fantasy is a forgotten masterpiece that needs to be experienced by anyone who loves cinema.

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    Fatal Games belongs in any self-respecting slasher movie completist’s collection. From the bonkers premise of a javelin-wielding maniac picking off Olympic hopefuls, to the laws of physics-defying death sequences (not to mention the killer theme song), Fatal Games is an absolute treat for fans of stalk-and-slash. What makes our release of the movie even more special is that this one truly defied the odds, with usable mastering elements proving elusive until only recently - and of course, the film comes accompanied by our usual array of newly-produced bonus features, laying bare the story of this unique production for the first time!

   <p>
    Are you looking for a spooky double feature with a possessed doll and 80s fashion? Look no further! Join Mexican music idol Pedro Fernández as he battles a doll with supernatural powers, alongside soap opera villain Gabriela Hassel in the first part and pop singer Tatiana in the sequel. Growing up in Mexico City in the 1980s, both titles were special to me. Producing the extras allowed me to pay tribute to the talented crew behind the practical effects at the iconic Estudio Churubusco and to the young actors, some of whom had successful careers in the entertainment industry.

   <p>
    "As someone who had no exposure to VS prior to working here, I had a lot of catching up to do. What better place to start than with Spanish, devil-worshiping horror? Satan’s Blood was one of my first VS watches and really helped me to understand the lure of what we put out. It’s an 82-minute, atmospheric descent into madness featuring charming main characters, a fun score, lots of gore, and a near-perfect ending. The addition of a human skull full of body butter and an eerie Ouija board scene definitely cement it as an essential October watch."

What's not to like about going frame by frame removing specks of dust, as Samantha Eggar uncontrollably spins around the room with a demonic hand grasping at the back of her head?! The movie itself is a trip, following a cursed, evil hand stopping at nothing as it jumps from one victim to the next."

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    "Nikos Nikolaidis’s kinky, darkly comical, chamber drama of horrors is like Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant for the S&amp;M set. Shot in a murky black and white, with an emphasis on meat, body hair, leather, and fluids, Nikolaidis lays his perversions, and fears, bare for a world audience to witness. Not a traditional horror movie by any stretch, SINGAPORE SLING has a more freewheeling kinship to the politically astute, and similarly transgressive, films of Dušan Makavejev than any of the titans of scare cinema, but there’s a reason Nikolaidis’s film has remained a stable of international freak-out cinema for over three decades; are you daring enough to discover why?"

    "Redneck Zombies catalyzed my, then unknown, love for [good] low-budget SOV movies. With likeable characters, great special effects and a fun story, it was unlike anything SOV I had ever seen at that point. I was used to being bored to tears while characters aimlessly wander or stand around saying and doing a whole lot of nothing. The opening theme song, the gory acid freakout and director Pericles Lewnes' Buck Flower caliber performance as "Elly May" will charm you right out of your burlap sack."

    "“They don’t allow you to have bees in here.” I discovered The Bees on my very first day of working at Vinegar Syndrome. Oscar was trying to show me the thousands of reels of film that still needed to be inspected, but I was too focused on one particular box of Blu-rays… “THE BEES!?!” I exclaimed. What a title! Now that’s a movie I need to watch. If you’re looking for a good example of MAN VS NATURE or ECO HORROR, then look no further than The Bees! What’s it about? The dangers of invasive species! Forget about spotted lanternflies - killer bees have invaded the United States, and John Saxon needs to get them under control before it’s too late."

    "If you ever felt like the Scanners series was lacking Scanning, this is the film for you. Nearly every single scene in this film exists as a showcase for new and outrageous Scanning abilities from hacking to bomb diffusion to endless goopy body melts. Patrick Kilpatrick gives an all-time performance as the serial killer scanner who looks like he’s about to explode every time he speaks. It feels like the logical endpoint for the series as every element is pushed to cartoonish extremes; every time I watch this, I can’t help but cheer and laugh the whole film."

    "It sounds crazy, but Night Train to Terror changed my life. It’s the first VinSyn title I watched, leaving me seeking more like it, and eventually a job here. My lasting memory was of a character insisting everything was “like Russian Roulette,” but in rewatching, there’s so many VinSyn hallmarks present: gratuitous nudity, cheap effects, evil hospitals, cults, satanists, and Cameron Mitchell. Between all that and a God/Satan debate while a band plays one song endlessly, what else could you want? I can’t guarantee this movie will change your life too, but I can say it’s like Russian Roulette."

    "Looking for a film with a good body and a strong aftertaste? Pop off the cork and let The Vineyard swirl in your Decanter as you ponder the temporality of youth and the blood, sweat and tears that goes into making a savory final product. The Vineyard has probably been my favorite Vinegar Syndrome horror film since I began here, largely due to my obsession with decay and fermentation, as well as my fixation with exploring macabre depths that one takes to prevent death. The 35mm original camera negative also holds a unique role in our film archive as one of the few elements that have left the film archive and subsequently returned in the years after. With its permanent home now within cold storage, you can be sure that the brilliantly conniving performance of the great James Hong will live on forever… or at least much longer than it would have otherwise!"

   <p>
    "I love Jess Franco. When anyone asks who my favorite filmmaker is, I say Jess Franco. Now, if they are not one of the converted, or at least familiar enough with his expansive filmography not to be one, they will ask for a recommendation… which — ikyk — can blow your credibility for future film conversations (and depending on the person asking, not a bad thing!) Would “Try Lorna the Exorcist!” work? No. You shouldn’t do that. Mean. You need to hit them with fun. Fun always wins a heart. But this is hard as Franco was many things as an artist, but rarely was he fun. Sure, there’s Lucky the Inscrutable, Anne Libert as Melissa the feathered oracle in Erotic Rites of Frankenstein… but the greatest good time is his Red Lips double feature, Two Undercover Angels and Kiss Me Monster. As ridiculous as they are endearing, Janine Reynaud and Rosanna Yanni knocking around two Euro “mysteries” is the perfect introduction to the wonderful world of Jess Franco… and bonus - also a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon."

Michael Moriarty (patron saint of character actors) is great, Jenny Agutter is her usual darkly alluring self and notably, director “Ken Barnett” is actually Freddie Francis of Amicus and Hammer fame, in his final directorial role."

    "You know what an "ear-worm" is? A song or melody you can't quite put your tongue on. Well, I've had an "eye-worm" for the better part of over three decades and just recently found out that it was the final kill from Larry Stouffer's low-budget revenge/slasher from 1973, Horror High. I won't ruin it, but it's pretty brutal, and it's been burned into my brain since I saw it on TV in the late 80s. For a low-budget, regional flick, it's extremely well done with a compelling lead, great pacing, and, of course, fun kills. Just remember to bring your baseball gear."

    The Lamp - aka the Outing
   </a>
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    "The Lamp is always my go-to recommendation for customers perusing the shop's VS section. It's a really fun slice of Texas-lensed horror that delivers on likable (and hateable) characters, interesting sets and creative kills. Deborah Winters steals the show as a no-nonsense taking, ass-kicking teacher and the love interest to our lead's father. During the titular 'outing', museum exhibits come to life and take life, with no Ben Stiller in sight. It's a real Night(mare) at the Museum."

    "Gorman Bechard’s Disconnected is not only one of my favorite flicks in our catalog, it’s also one of my favorite films made in our beautiful home state of Connecticut. Shot on weekends in and around the Connecticut River Valley and New Haven by Gorman and his great crew of locals, it is truly an incredible time capsule of mid-80s New England that really adds an extra layer of kitsch and character to this avant-garde, micro-budget horror gem."

    "I first came across Island of Blood (aka Whodunit) in the video rental section of a Hy-Vee grocery store in early '90s Iowa. The twisty, gore-soaked film was an amazing late-night watch in the basement of my parents' house. Flash-forward thirty years, and I'm on the phone with the film's director, William T. Naud, discussing his time producing game shows for NBC, founding the National Security Agency (never bothered fact-checking), and protecting codebreakers during the Korean War from killer Communist bikini models. I was thoroughly entertained by both his film work and his personal stories. RIP Bill."

   <p>
    "If you’re a fan of classic monsters, gothic horror, and the films of Hammer, you’re doing yourself a massive disservice by not watching Paul Naschy’s The Werewolf Versus The Vampire Woman. The third film in the Waldemar Daninsky werewolf series, this entry easily stands out as one of the best in the franchise! Naschy could only be rivaled by Christopher Lee as Dracula (in number of performances and quality). This film serves as an excellent launching point if you’re unfamiliar with his filmography. (I also recommend Count Dracula’s Great Love!)"

    Killer Condom

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    "Ralf König’s comic classic Killer Condom blends absurdist horror with unexpected social commentary. Udo Samel’s gruff Detective Mackeroni is a trailblazing, openly gay protagonist, rejecting stereotypes while navigating his sexuality and the bizarre case. The portrayal of sex work is also noteworthy, with Leonard Lansink’s Babette offering a mix of camp and complexity, giving agency to a marginalized role. The film challenges norms and subverts harmful stereotypes, all while delivering raucous, outrageous fun. Through its unique characters and memorable moments, Killer Condom remains an instant classic."

   <p>
    "Evil Laugh is an 80’s slasher with all the requisite ingredients of gore, sleaze, haunted house, goofy humor, clueless horny youngsters with six-packs and perky breasts, and an off-with-the-mask-reveal finale. Dominick Brascia, of miniscule "Friday the 13th: A New Beginning" fame, is both the director and creator of the bizarre kill-scene cackles. Writer/Actor Steven Baio wrote himself into the best humor bit and kill scene involving a microwave. Together they produced a thoroughly entertaining film with plenty of hilarious and WTF moments. Try to guess which actors go on to become an infamous Hollywood Madame, an award-winning porn star, and a professor at Stanford University."

MAUSOLEUM was amongst the first handful I watched, curious to see what I was getting into. It did not disappoint, delivering ample gore, impressive practical effects, a touch of sleaze, and a lot of heart. Needless to say, this 'quintessential VS' title spurred a wild journey down the VS rabbit hole, unlocking an appreciation of an era and style of film that I otherwise wouldn’t have found. And for that, I am forever grateful!"

    Dead Heat
   </a>
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    "DEAD HEAT is not only a personal childhood favorite, but it's a solid example of a movie which simply gets better with age. The late, great Treat Williams (a native of nearby Rowayton, CT) landed this film in what some would consider a low point of his career and yet he still delivered just like the true professional he was. In a buddy-cop mode with Joe Piscopo (who's actually funny here), Treat is at the emotional center of this sharply comic action/horror flick, which clearly knows what kind of movie it is. Relying on quick action and solid dialogue, DEAD HEAT is a consistently fun ride with more than enough stunts and effects to keep any exploitation fan happy. And where else can you get Darren McGavin gleefully playing a coroner?"
