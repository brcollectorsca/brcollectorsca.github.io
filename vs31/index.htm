href="https://vinegarsyndrome.com/products/ebola-syndrome">Ebola
Syndrome</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I vividly remember the process of restoring Ebola Syndrome. The
elements were in rough shape, and 4k is unforgiving regarding hiding
damage. We made countless passes, and I went through this film frame by
frame for weeks. It was like Clockwork Orange, watching all the sex and
violence over and over. In restoration, there’s no audio, no dialogue or
subtitles, and no rhythm to the narrative. Just what you see on screen.
And this movie looked fucking wild. Sex, dismemberment, golden showers,
and murder…and that’s only the first 5 minutes. When I finally got to
watch the movie, I was ready for the depravity and dying to discover
what was happening in the story. By the end, I was completely blown
away. The story took twists and turns, was equal parts hilarious and
atrocious and checks off all things you want in an extreme horror film.
Add in Anthony Wong and all the charm he brings to the scuzziest of
characters, and this was an instant classic. When it comes to VS
releases, I’m proud of the work we did, but more importantly, this movie
fucks, and it should be on every film lover’s shelf.</p>

Fantasy</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The images on the screen during its runtime bring to mind films such
as Carnival of Souls, Eyes Without a Face, and my all-time favorite, The
Night of the Hunter (Stanley Cortez was the Cinematographer on both NOTH
and Flesh and Fantasy!). While viewing it for the first time, I was so
taken aback by the nightmarish imagery on the screen that I could not
fully absorb it all, so I re-watched it a second time immediately
afterward. Flesh and Fantasy is a forgotten masterpiece that needs to be
experienced by anyone who loves cinema.</p>

href="https://vinegarsyndrome.com/products/fatal-games">Fatal
Games</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Fatal Games belongs in any self-respecting slasher movie completist’s
collection. From the bonkers premise of a javelin-wielding maniac
picking off Olympic hopefuls, to the laws of physics-defying death
sequences (not to mention the killer theme song), Fatal Games is an
absolute treat for fans of stalk-and-slash. What makes our release of
the movie even more special is that this one truly defied the odds, with
usable mastering elements proving elusive until only recently - and of
course, the film comes accompanied by our usual array of newly-produced
bonus features, laying bare the story of this unique production for the
first time!</p>

of Terror 1 &amp; 2</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you looking for a spooky double feature with a possessed doll and
80s fashion? Look no further! Join Mexican music idol Pedro Fernández as
he battles a doll with supernatural powers, alongside soap opera villain
Gabriela Hassel in the first part and pop singer Tatiana in the sequel.
Growing up in Mexico City in the 1980s, both titles were special to me.
Producing the extras allowed me to pay tribute to the talented crew
behind the practical effects at the iconic Estudio Churubusco and to the
young actors, some of whom had successful careers in the entertainment
industry.</p>

Blood</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“As someone who had no exposure to VS prior to working here, I had a
lot of catching up to do. What better place to start than with Spanish,
devil-worshiping horror? Satan’s Blood was one of my first VS watches
and really helped me to understand the lure of what we put out. It’s an
82-minute, atmospheric descent into madness featuring charming main
characters, a fun score, lots of gore, and a near-perfect ending. The
addition of a human skull full of body butter and an eerie Ouija board
scene definitely cement it as an essential October watch.”</p>
